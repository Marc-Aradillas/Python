# Python
Python code practice and projects.

Text Based game built in the Pycharm IDE. The program is able to compile, 
but I cannot get it run approproately as it needs to have the code revised
and get actions to run approprately.

- take direction in north south west east and and be able to pick up items 
in each room. All items need to be on the player's inventory to enter last
room and successfuly complete the game
